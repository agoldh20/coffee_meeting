Hey ,

My name is Adam, I'm currently a chef transitioning into a full stack web developer. I found an interest in coding a few years back playing with codecademy.com, and now Iâ€™ve reached the end of my cohort with Actualize Bootcamp. I was hoping you would be able to help me first hand. Could we meet so I could pick your brain about the profession from someone that's been in IT recruitment for a while?

Let me know an afternoon when you'd be able to do coffee at a Starbucks near you.

Thanks!
